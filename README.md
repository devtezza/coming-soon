## Overview

### About

Status: Finished\
The purpose of this project is to practice UI design (using Figma) and front end development skills. It's a simple coming soon landing page that runs a countdown to the date and the time selected by the user. 

### Features
- [x] Users should be able to:
   - [x] view the layout according to the device's screen size
   - [x] view the modal screen, which has to be automatically open if they don't click the toggle button (5 seconds after the page is loaded) 
   - [x] select a date and a time to activate the countdown animation, by using the modal screen interface
   - [x] open and close modal screen whenever they want
   - [x] stop and clear the counter by clicking the "Stop" button or when they close the website's window
   - [x] simulate a newsletter subscription: when they enter an e-mail address on the submit form, a message must appear in order to notify the user if they typed a valid e-mail format or not
